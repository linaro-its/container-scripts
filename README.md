This repository is used as the "source of truth" of the two scripts used by contributors to Linaro's static web sites. In other words, if there is any concern that the `build-site.sh` or `check-links.sh` script in a git repository are out-of-date or have deviated from the master copy, that can easily be checked by looking at the scripts in this repository.

The two scripts are added to each static web site repository, along with the associated `CODEOWNERS` file and configuration changes to git and Jekyll to provide an optimal build-and-check experience.
